# OpenSpec usage canon

This normative canon governs OpenSpec as the repository's 42P change mechanism, subordinate to [SPEC.md](../../SPEC.md). **MUST** and **MUST NOT** are mandatory. Apply the [editorial standard](editorial.md) and [technical canon](software.md) throughout.

## Project and CLI location

`.42p` is the OpenSpec project root; `.42p/openspec/` contains its configuration, changes and realization canon. Keep the built-in `spec-driven` schema. MUST NOT use an OpenSpec Store, `--store`, or a repository-root `openspec/`.

Normal OpenSpec CLI commands MUST execute with `.42p` as working directory. From the repository root:

```sh
cd .42p
openspec list
openspec list --specs
openspec status --change <change>
openspec validate --all --strict
openspec instructions proposal --change <change> --json
openspec archive <change>
```

MUST NOT run normal commands from the repository root or rely on downward discovery of `.42p/openspec/`. Setup/update operations that accept a project path MUST target `.42p`; pathless refresh commands MUST run from `.42p`. Initial setup from the repository root is `openspec init .42p --tools agents --profile core`. Then select the core workflows plus `verify` before refreshing the generated skills as described below. Install the official CLI in the execution environment; this integration does not require a repository dependency.

Before any workflow write, resolve the local project with `openspec list --json` or `openspec context --json` from `.42p`. The returned project root MUST be this checkout's `.42p`; generated change and spec paths MUST remain inside `.42p/openspec/`. Stop on a missing or different root. Interpret generated `openspec/...` paths relative to `.42p`; repository implementation files remain relative to the repository root, its parent.

## Generated skills

Shared skills live under `.42p/.agents/skills/openspec-*/`; `.42p/.agents/skills/.openspec-target` is generated target metadata. MUST read and use the appropriate generated `SKILL.md` for a workflow. MUST NOT hand-edit these files. Refresh them through the OpenSpec CLI when required.

The required workflow selection is the core set (`propose`, `explore`, `apply`, `update`, `sync`, `archive`) plus `verify`. The core profile alone does not install `openspec-verify-change`. To reproduce this selection in the execution environment, then refresh from `.42p`:

```sh
openspec config set profile custom
openspec config set workflows '["propose","explore","apply","update","sync","archive","verify"]'
openspec config set delivery skills
openspec update
```

These settings configure the execution environment; generated repository skills remain CLI-owned. Keep this workflow selection when refreshing so Verification remains available.

Use the generated skills directly in ChatGPT Work by reading their files through repository access. Add an adapter only for a demonstrated Work incompatibility; MUST NOT duplicate workflow logic in advance. Repository 42P rules override generic OpenSpec assumptions where they differ, including fluid Apply and archive suggestions.

## Authority and lifecycle

The authority chain is:

`SPEC.md` → Capture → Allocation → OpenSpec realization canon → Proposition → implementation → Verification.

SPEC.md remains the sole authoritative product contract. [Capture and Allocation](../engineering/) remain the authoritative rationale and allocation toward realization within their derived scope, subordinate to SPEC.md. Neither OpenSpec artifacts nor task completion can change that authority or establish implementation acceptance.

The normal operational path is:

Allocation → `propose` → allocation/change coverage gate → `apply` → 42P Verification → `archive`.

1. **Propose.** Each Change MUST realize exactly one allocation unit. Use `openspec-propose` to derive the Change's proposal, delta specs, design and tasks from that unit. Record the Allocation snapshot and the stable allocation handle used. MUST NOT introduce unallocated product requirements. The generated `proposal.md` is the OpenSpec Proposition artifact; it is drafted here and constrains implementation together with the other Change artifacts.
2. **Coverage gate.** Before Apply, record a bidirectional mapping from every requirement of the allocation unit realized by the Change to OpenSpec requirements and back, with relevant scenarios and tasks. Allocation unit → Change coverage MUST be 100% and Change → allocation unit coverage MUST be 100%: no requirement of that unit missing, no OpenSpec requirement without authority from that unit. Other allocation units need not be proposed or synchronized before this Change is implemented. Missing, contradictory or insufficient upstream content, or a required semantic change, MUST stop the workflow and escalate to the upstream authority. MUST NOT resolve it by local reinterpretation.
3. **Apply.** Use `openspec-apply-change` only after coverage. Apply MUST remain constrained by the Change and repository standards. MUST NOT reinterpret upstream authority, narrow obligations or add unallocated requirements. If an artifact needs a semantic revision, stop and escalate; repeat coverage for an authorized revision before resuming Apply.
4. **Verification.** After Apply, follow the [Verification standard](verification.md): confirm 100% bidirectional allocation-unit/Change coverage, use `openspec-verify-change`, and run repository checks and applicable tests. These three controls constitute the distinct post-Apply Verification stage; MUST NOT add a fourth verification procedure. Record their evidence and verdict. Task checkboxes, file-existence status and OpenSpec structural validation alone MUST NOT substitute for Verification or product acceptance.
5. **Archive.** Use `openspec-archive-change` only after satisfactory 42P Verification. Archive may propose or apply synchronization of delta specs through the native OpenSpec workflow. MUST NOT use incomplete-work confirmations to bypass an earlier gate. If invoking the archive CLI, use `openspec archive <change>`. Archive records completed work; it does not replace Verification or authorize merge/publication.

`openspec-sync-specs` is optional after implementation and before archive, not a mandatory 42P stage. Sync is an agent workflow, not an assumed `openspec sync` CLI command. Strict validation MUST pass; synchronization does not claim implementation exists.

The other generated core workflows (`openspec-explore` and `openspec-update-change`) are supporting operations, not extra 42P lifecycle stages. MUST NOT use them to bypass Capture, Allocation, coverage or Verification. Any semantic update invalidates affected coverage and verification evidence until reconciled through the same gates.
