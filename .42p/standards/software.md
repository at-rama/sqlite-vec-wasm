# Technical repository canon

This is the repository-wide engineering authority, subordinate to the instituted design decisions and sources under [the repository authority rules](../../AGENTS.md). It translates repository concerns from the two current [Captures and global Allocation](../engineering/) without changing their scoped obligations or giving the Captures decision authority. Executable configuration defines the current checks; this document explains their scope and prerequisites.

## Lightweight repository gateway

The lightweight check uses a Git checkout, Git 2.18 or newer, a POSIX shell with standard utilities, and Python 3.9 or newer for offline source-lock validation. No dependency installation, network access, cache, or unpublished local file is needed. From the repository root:

```sh
sh tools/check-repository.sh
```

Stage new files before checking so Git includes them in the candidate snapshot. The command checks the complete tracked working snapshot for Git whitespace errors and rejects tracked files matching repository `.gitignore` rules, even if force-added. Local/global ignore configuration does not affect that rejection. It rejects a root `SPEC.md` in any letter case, including an untracked root entry. It requires tracked regular public/agent/canon entry points and current Capture inputs, and checks that the single global Allocation names every tracked Capture exactly once with its current SHA-256. The number of Captures is not fixed by this check; input identities do not establish semantic coverage. It returns nonzero on any failure and also validates the source lock offline. Automated suites run in the separate test command below. Apart from the retired root specification, it does not check arbitrary untracked files or prove absence of renamed/copied upstream sources; review still enforces those source boundaries.

The same command is mandatory for every proposed change and runs as `Repository / check` in pull-request and `main` CI. A successful repository check is not product acceptance or permission to publish. Changes to this gateway or its configuration must retain meaningful failure behavior; new integrity checks enter this command when their implementation subjects exist; automated test suites enter the separate test command below. Do not bypass failures or substitute always-successful commands.

The versioned [canon manifest](canon.sha256) identifies the protected operational canon: `AGENTS.md`, the five standards in `.42p/standards/`, and `.42p/openspec/config.yaml`. Each line contains a lowercase 64-character SHA-256, two spaces, and a repository-relative path; entries are unique, sorted by path, and name Git-tracked regular files without symlinks. Empty/malformed manifests, invalid paths/digests, missing/untracked files and byte mismatches fail. The manifest is tracked but does not hash itself. The gateway checks these byte identities without interpreting editorial wording. A PR can jointly change a protected file and its manifest digest; review and human integration authorize the change, not the hash check. Changing the protected set likewise requires review of the manifest. No comparison to `main` freezes legitimate evolution.

Captures and Allocation are non-authoritative engineering projections with their existing separate input-identity check; they are not added to this manifest. Their joint revision still requires matching Capture snapshots in Allocation. README, historical evidence, archives, technical architecture and agent skills are not automatically included in the operational-canon set. Source locks, Verification reports and Change gates retain their existing machine-contract validations. Update the manifest after editing protected bytes, including this document; workflow commands and required-check contexts remain unchanged.

Run `sh tools/test-repository.sh` for the registered automated suites, using Python 3.9 or newer and the existing system Bash, tar and unzip for acquisition fixtures. The build-orchestration suite also requires Node 18 or newer and a native C compiler; the packaging suite additionally uses system npm for local archive packing/installation and Python for archive inspection. Neither requires SDK installation or network access. The registered suites run independently as the `tests` CI job; mandatory tests must not be replaced by report declarations. The [pull-request gate canon](gates.md) defines the separate Verification and Archive jobs and required-check configuration. These merge gates do not enter the lightweight local command or become prerequisites for producing a Verification report.

## Controlled and generated material

Keep repository-authored inputs, validation configuration, and necessary dependency/version records in Git. Acquire upstream sources and place generated outputs, temporary dependencies, caches, and verification evidence in ignored `.work/` (or outside the checkout). Never depend on its pre-existing contents. `.gitignore` also protects recognizable SQLite outputs from accidental staging outside that workspace; the gate rejects tracked ignored material. This is an acquisition/output convention, not a product module layout.

Before introducing any build or verification dependency, record the exact versions/options that materially affect its results and use the ecosystem's lockfile/integrity mechanism where applicable. External CI actions use full commit identities. A hosted OS label selects a platform, not an immutable product build environment. Portable Git/shell operations need no additional runtime manager or package lockfile.

## Shared engineering boundaries

Keep upstream boundaries and allowable glue as preserved in the Distribution Capture and allocated responsibilities; do not introduce a shared framework ahead of a concrete need. Component-specific realization choices belong in the [technical architecture](../engineering/2026-10-04_sqlite-vec-wasm_technical_architecture_edit-0.1.md), subordinate to instituted product decisions; they are not repository-wide engineering rules.

## Validation obligations

For harness changes, installation, locked dependencies and smoke verification are mandatory in addition to the lightweight check; changes to acquisition/bootstrap must also be reconstructed in an isolated checkout with empty tool/npm state. Follow the [harness architecture](../engineering/2026-10-04_sqlite-vec-wasm_technical_architecture_edit-0.1.md) for system prerequisites and execution constraints, then run from the repository root:

```sh
bash tools/harness.sh install
bash tools/harness.sh deps
bash tools/harness.sh smoke
sh tools/check-repository.sh
```

Use `bash tools/harness.sh check` for an independent identity check and `bash tools/harness.sh exec COMMAND [ARG ...]` to run a command in the verified tooling environment.

These tooling checks do not replace product acceptance or human merge authority preserved in the Distribution Capture. Missing prerequisites or failed checks must fail rather than silently skip required verification. Do not infer broader qualification or release readiness from a passing tooling check.
